0,"This misconception occurs when students fail to understand the fundamental property that all triangles have internal angles summing to 180 degrees. This is a basic principle in Euclidean geometry that applies to all triangles regardless of their shape or size.","For example, if a triangle has angles of 45° and 60°, a student with this misconception might suggest the third angle could be 85° (which would sum to 190°) instead of the correct 75° (45° + 60° + 75° = 180°).","To correct this misconception, use visual demonstrations with protractors on different triangle shapes. Have students physically measure all three angles and add them. Interactive geometry software can also help students visualize how the angles always sum to 180° even when the triangle's shape changes."
1,"This misconception happens when students incorrectly apply the division rule for fractions (multiply by the reciprocal) when they should be multiplying. They invert the second fraction when they should simply multiply numerators and denominators directly.","If asked to calculate 2/3 × 3/4, a student with this misconception might incorrectly invert the second fraction and calculate 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9, instead of the correct approach: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2.","Use visual representations like fraction bars or diagrams to demonstrate multiplication of fractions. Compare the process with division to highlight the differences. Provide clear step-by-step procedures and have students explain each step to reinforce understanding."
2,"This misconception involves confusion about angle measurement, where students believe a full rotation is 100 degrees instead of the correct 360 degrees. This may stem from confusing degrees with the decimal system or percentages.","A student might say that a quarter turn is 25 degrees (1/4 of 100) instead of the correct 90 degrees (1/4 of 360). Or they might describe a 180° angle as a '50-degree angle' thinking it's 50% of a full turn.","Use physical demonstrations with protractors and compass drawing to reinforce the standard 360-degree system. Have students perform complete rotations while counting degrees. Connect to real-world examples like clock faces to build intuition about angle measurements."
7,"This misconception occurs when students calculate only the vertical change (rise) and forget to divide by the horizontal change (run) when finding the gradient of a line. They treat gradient as simply the difference in y-coordinates.","If asked to find the gradient between points (2,3) and (5,9), a student with this misconception would give the answer as 6 (the difference between y-coordinates: 9-3=6), instead of the correct calculation: (9-3)/(5-2) = 6/3 = 2.","Consistently use the phrase 'rise over run' and the formula m=(y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁). Use visual aids showing the triangle formed when calculating gradient. Provide real-world contexts like ramps and hills to give meaning to the gradient concept."
8,"This misconception happens when students incorrectly assume that any two angles that form a straight line must be equal to each other. They fail to understand that while angles on a straight line sum to 180°, the individual angles can have different measures.","If there are two angles on a straight line, and one angle is 30°, a student with this misconception would state that the other angle must also be 30°, rather than the correct answer of 150° (because 30° + 150° = 180°).","Use physical models with adjustable angles to demonstrate various combinations that form 180°. Encourage students to measure different pairs of angles on straight lines to discover that while they always sum to 180°, the individual angles can vary widely."
143,"This misconception involves students believing that when simplifying algebraic expressions, terms with different variables can be combined directly (e.g., 3x + 2y = 5xy). They fail to understand that only like terms can be combined.","When asked to simplify 4a + 3b, a student with this misconception might give the answer as 7ab or 7(a+b), instead of recognizing that 4a + 3b cannot be simplified further because a and b are different variables.","Use concrete examples with numerical substitution to show why unlike terms cannot be combined. For instance, if a=2 and b=3, then 4a + 3b = 4(2) + 3(3) = 8 + 9 = 17, but 7ab would equal 7(2)(3) = 42, which is clearly different."
1073,"This misconception occurs when students think that the value inside a square root can be distributed to separate terms. For example, they incorrectly believe that √(a + b) equals √a + √b.","A student might calculate √(9 + 16) as √9 + √16 = 3 + 4 = 7, instead of the correct approach: √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.","Provide counterexamples with numbers to disprove the misconception. Use visual representations of areas to demonstrate why square roots don't distribute. Practice identifying expressions where the distributive property does and doesn't apply."
1180,"This misconception involves students believing that dividing a fraction by a whole number means dividing just the numerator by that number, rather than multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor.","When calculating 3/4 ÷ 2, a student with this misconception might incorrectly compute 3÷2/4 = 1.5/4 = 1 1/2 ÷ 4 = 3/8, instead of the correct approach: 3/4 ÷ 2 = 3/4 × 1/2 = 3/8.","Teach the 'keep, change, flip' procedure for division of fractions. Use visual models to demonstrate why division by a number is equivalent to multiplication by its reciprocal. Connect to real-world scenarios involving fair sharing to build conceptual understanding."
1287,"This misconception occurs when students conclude that all quadrilaterals with two pairs of equal sides must be rectangles, failing to recognize that rhombuses also have all sides equal but aren't rectangles unless they have right angles.","A student might incorrectly identify a rhombus (with all sides equal but no right angles) as a rectangle, or insist that a figure can't be both a rhombus and a square, not understanding that a square is a special case of a rhombus.","Create a Venn diagram showing the relationships between quadrilateral types. Use manipulatives to transform shapes between different quadrilateral categories. Focus on precise definitions, emphasizing that rectangles require right angles while rhombuses require equal sides."
1672,"This misconception involves students not understanding the order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS), particularly regarding when to use brackets to alter the standard order of calculation in mathematical expressions.","When evaluating 3 × 2 + 4 - 5, a student might calculate from left to right: (3 × 2) + 4 - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 5, instead of following BIDMAS: 3 × 2 + 4 - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 5. However, if trying to get 13 as the answer, they need to place brackets: 3 × (2 + 4) - 5 = 3 × 6 - 5 = 18 - 5 = 13.","Use the acronym BIDMAS/PEMDAS consistently and provide plenty of practice with increasingly complex expressions. Demonstrate how brackets can change the order of operations and therefore the result. Use real-world examples to illustrate why the order matters."
1818,"This misconception occurs when students believe that percentages are always calculated out of 100 units, failing to understand that percentages can be applied to any quantity.","A student might calculate 20% of 250 as 20, incorrectly thinking that percentages only apply to quantities of 100. The correct calculation would be 20% of 250 = 0.20 × 250 = 50.","Emphasize that 'percent' means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100,' so 20% means 20 per 100 or 20/100 = 0.20. Practice converting percentages to decimals and fractions. Use visual models to demonstrate percentages of different quantities."
2142,"This misconception involves students believing that any number raised to the power of zero equals zero, rather than understanding that any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one.","A student might calculate 7⁰ = 0, instead of the correct result: 7⁰ = 1. Similarly, they might think x⁰ = 0 for any value of x, rather than recognizing that x⁰ = 1 for any non-zero x.","Demonstrate the pattern as exponents decrease: e.g., 2³ = 8, 2² = 4, 2¹ = 2, 2⁰ = ? Guide students to notice that each step divides by 2, so 2⁰ should be 2¹ ÷ 2 = 1. Use the definition of exponents and algebraic proof to reinforce that x⁰ = 1."
